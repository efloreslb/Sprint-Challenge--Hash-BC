# Sprint Challenge: Hash Tables and Blockchain

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint, we learned how hash tables combine two data structures to get the best of both worlds and were introduced into the fascinating world of blockchains. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by solving algorithms in Python using hash tables and add another key feature to your blockchain.

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Python and your command of the concepts and techniques in related to hash tables and blockchains.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons and your project manager.

## Description

This sprint challenge is divided up into three parts:  Hash tables coding, blockchain coding, and a short interview covering parts of hash tables and blockchain.

## Interview Questions

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:
* What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?
   - Accessing an array has a runtime compelxity of O(1) as long as you use it's index.
   - Adding and removing from the front of an array has a varying time complexity. The worst case scenario is O(n) due to all elements after the first element will have to be shifted.
   - Adding or removing from the back of an array also has a varying time complexity. The worst case scenario is O(n) due to the possibility of all elements having to be copied to a new array when the current array is full.
* What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?
   - Extending the size of a dynamic array will be O(n) because every element in the array will have to be copied.

Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?
   - Blockchain is a set of objects where each object can essentially vouch for the the previous object in the chain by including data only attainable by performing a required algorithm. This also means that the last current block includes data that has been dependent on each block that preceded it. 
   - Blocks contain verious idenfying data but they must contain a proof of work, hash for all of it's information, the hash of the previous block, and a list of transactions.
   - The chain links all these blocks together by each block having the hash of the block that came before it. 
 
Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack. What kind of attack is possible?
   - Proof of work is given by a block after it computes a complicated algorithm and it is checked by the last block in the chain. If that proof of work is validated then the block is added to the chain as it's last block. Other blocks that may have been trying to compute the same algorithm for that previous last block will not be validated because there is a new block at the end. This protects the chain because it requires large amounts of computing power to mine new blocks. One possible attack is a 51% attack (majority attack) where a user(s) can own majority of the computing power and therefore create the longest chain of blocks. However, once the attack is discovered it is not profitable for attackers since the blockchain will lose it's credibility.

## Project Set Up

#### [Hash Tables]

For the hash tables portion of the sprint challenge, you'll be working through two algorithm problems that are amenable to being solved efficiently using a hash table. You know the drill at this point. Navigate into each exercise's directory, read the instructions for the exercise laid out in the README, implement your solution in the .py skeleton file, then make sure your code passes the tests by running the test script with make tests.

A hash table implementation has been included for you already. Your task is to get the tests passing (using a hash table to do it). You can remind yourself of what hash table functions are available by looking at the hashtable.py file that is included in each exercise directory (note that the hash table implementations for both exercises differ slightly).

*You may not use any advanced, built-in Python functions to solve these problems.*

#### [Blockchain]

For the blockchain portion of the challenge, you will be writing code for a new miner that will solve a different Proof of Work algorithm than the one we have been working with.

Your goal is to mine at least one coin.  Keep in mind that with many people competing over the same coins, this may take a long time.  By our math, we expect that an average solution should be the first to find a solution at least once in an hour or two of mining.
